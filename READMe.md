## Features include but are not limited to:

* Write plist files with spaces for indentation to fit all editors or editing environments, such as the Shell editing environment

* Powerful keyword search function, including retrieval of unseen data tables

* All tabs and checkbox text are supported for copying (right-click menu)

* Unlimited levels of undo and redo (automatically cleared when opening a new file)

* Copy and paste rows between multiple processes and single processes

* Well-built data structures to accommodate rapid iterations of OpenCore

* Built-in configuration file database ([Share configuration file](https://github.com/ic005k/QtOpenCoreConfigDatabase/issues))

* Generate EFI folders on the desktop based on configuration files

* Each function option adopts suspension prompt and status bar prompt

* Keep up with the latest development version of OpenCore and keep pace with it completely

* Double-click to open the file, drag and drop the file to the software interface to open the file, and open the file history display

* All three platforms use OC's official macserial to generate serial numbers

* Software UI adapts to various resolutions, including winpe and linux livecd, etc.
